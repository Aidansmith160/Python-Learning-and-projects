I'm trying to learn french at the same time as python and decided to try and combine the two. 
This project is a simple game whereby the programme picks a random infinitive of a verb and asks you to conjugate that word. 
At the moment this is set up for learning the passe compose but it can be altered easily to accomodate other examples of verb conjugation
